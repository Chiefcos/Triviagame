# Triviagame

I build a trivia game for the homework assignment.
It was a very challenging assignment.
I was happy to succeed in dynamically creating HTML elements and using an array of objects to construct my questions and answers.

Unfortunatly not all of my functionality works perfect, there are some bugs when it comes to the answer screens ( the one's inbetween that show correct and incorrect answers and shows the correct answer when the time is up).

I have spent over 14 hours trying to create this application.
